## Education

* **Universit√© de Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier**, Toulouse | 2023 - 2024
    * Master 2 in Sports Performance Analysis, with highest honors
    * Thesis: Advanced Biomechanical Modeling for Elite Rugby Performance Optimization
    * Relevant classes: Data Analytics in Sports, Advanced Biomechanics, Performance Psychology, Sports Physiology, Statistical Modeling for Sports Science

* **INSA Toulouse**, Toulouse | 2022 - 2023
    * Master 1 in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science, ranked 1 among 150 students
    * Classes attended: Statistical Learning, Optimization, Data Visualization, Numerical Analysis, Machine Learning Fundamentals

## Experience

* **Stade Toulousain Rugby Club Performance Laboratory** | April - September 2024
    * Under the joint supervision of Dr. L. Moreau (Performance Director) and Prof. J. Dubois (University of Toulouse)
        * Daily collaboration with Dr. Moreau and weekly meetings with Prof. Dubois.
        * Participated in national and international sports science conferences.
    * Subject: Development of a Predictive Model for Injury Prevention in Elite Rugby Players
    * Designed and implemented a machine learning model to predict injury risk based on biomechanical data, physiological metrics, and training load. Developed a novel feature engineering approach to capture complex interactions between variables.
    * Implementation in Python using scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and custom data visualization tools.
    * Short abstract of the master thesis: This research investigates the development of a predictive model for injury prevention in elite rugby players using advanced machine learning techniques. We leverage a comprehensive dataset encompassing biomechanical, physiological, and training load data. By employing sophisticated feature engineering and model selection strategies, we aim to identify key predictors of injury risk and develop a robust predictive tool. The model demonstrates high accuracy in identifying players at risk, enabling proactive interventions to mitigate injuries and enhance player availability.

* **French National Rugby Team Analytics Department** | June - July 2023
    * Under the supervision of Dr. C. Bernard (Head of Analytics)
        * Weekly meetings with Dr. Bernard and collaboration with team analysts.
    * Subject: Tactical Pattern Recognition and Opponent Strategy Analysis using Time-Series Data
    * Developed an algorithm to identify and analyze tactical patterns in rugby matches using time-series data from player movements and ball possession. Proposed a novel method for visualizing and interpreting complex tactical sequences.
    * Implementation in R and Python, using libraries for time-series analysis and network visualization.
    * More detailed version: This project focuses on the application of advanced time-series analysis techniques to identify and analyze tactical patterns in rugby matches. We developed an algorithm to extract meaningful features from player movement and ball possession data, enabling the identification of recurring tactical sequences. The analysis provides insights into opponent strategies and facilitates the development of effective counter-tactics.
